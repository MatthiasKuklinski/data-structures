# Stack (Array-Based Implementation)
A stack is a linear collection of data elements, where insertion and deletion of elements takes place at the top of the stack. A stack implementation follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. 

## Common area of application
Since a stack enforces sequential rules of access, a common area of application can be a history trace (e.g. browser-history), where the last visited website is pushed onto the top of the stack as an element (URL). Each time the back button is pressed, the element (URL) at the top of the stack is removed.
A stack can also be used to reverse a word. Each character in the string is pushed onto the stack. Afterwards each character is removed from of the stack. The result is a reversed string.
