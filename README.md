## About
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.  
More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Data structures can be subvided into the following major categories:

| Category | Data structures | Description |
| -------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Linear | Arrays, Lists | A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence. |
| Non-linear | Trees, Heaps | A data structure is said to be non-linear if its elements do not form a sequence. |
